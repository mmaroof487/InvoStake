<h2>Problem InvoStake Solves</h2>

<h3>Liquidity Challenges</h3>
<p>
<strong>Tokens locked in long-term investments:</strong> These do not contribute to liquidity pools, reducing the overall efficiency of capital in the ecosystem.  
<strong>Multiple isolated liquidity pools:</strong> This dilutes the depth of liquidity, causing inefficiencies in trading, higher slippage, and reduced market stability.
</p>

<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>
<strong>Limited privacy-preserving mechanisms:</strong> Users face concerns around data security and trust.  
InvoStake solves this by implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure secure and private data analysis.
</p>

<h3>AI-Powered Investments</h3>
<p>
Our AI agent creates a basket of tokens tailored to the user's risk appetite while identifying fair value gaps in trading candles.
</p>

<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>
<p>
<strong>Implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):</strong> This process was time-intensive and complex, requiring significant effort to ensure successful integration.
</p>

<h2>Tech Stack and Tools Used</h2>
<p>
<strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong>  
- Solidity (Smart contract development)  
- React (Frontend framework)  
- JavaScript (Dynamic functionality and scripting)  
- C++ (Performance-critical components)  
- Python (AI model development and backend integration)  
- Foundry (Blockchain development framework)  
- Move (Smart contract language for blockchain modules)  
- TradingView API (Real-time charting and trading data)  
- Ocean Protocol (Secure and decentralized data sharing)  
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
<strong>1. Liquidity Optimization:</strong> Unlocks the potential of locked tokens by enabling their contribution to liquidity pools.  
<strong>2. Privacy Preservation:</strong> Utilizes FHE to secure user data while ensuring trust in data analysis processes.  
<strong>3. AI-Driven Token Basket:</strong> Offers investment baskets based on user risk profiles and market trends.  
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
<strong>1. Token Analysis:</strong> The platform analyzes token data using TradingView and Ocean Protocol APIs.  
<strong>2. AI Agent:</strong> Identifies trading opportunities and constructs a token basket for users.  
<strong>3. Privacy Mechanism:</strong> Ensures all user data analysis is encrypted and secure using FHE.  
<strong>4. Liquidity Contribution:</strong> Allows idle assets to be utilized in liquidity pools to maximize capital efficiency.  
</p>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>
<strong>1. Clone the repository:</strong>
<pre><code>git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;</code></pre>
<strong>2. Install dependencies:</strong>
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
<strong>3. Start the frontend:</strong>
<pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
<strong>4. Deploy smart contracts using Foundry:</strong>
<pre><code>forge deploy</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> Expanding support for more blockchain ecosystems.  
<strong>2.</strong> Enhancing AI models for better token selection and portfolio management.  
<strong>3.</strong> Improving scalability of FHE to reduce computational overhead.
